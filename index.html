If we write it in engligh but try to display in arabic it will get all messed up. Apparently called MOJIBAKE! HOWEVER utf-8 is the standard encoding, and apparently includes all the symbols we need for any language, which is cool. It's about 'rendering' the website, using utf-8 will give it the best chance of being rendered correctly -->
